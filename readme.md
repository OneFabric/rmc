## Assumptions

The path to 'main.sh' from '~/' is '~/Desktop/rmc/scripts/main.sh'

'main.sh' is runnable ( i.e. has permissions to be run ).

'movies.txt' has movies in the format as specified on [imdb.com](https://www.imdb.com/)

You have an API key from rapidAPI, uTelly that you can pass in when you run 'main.sh'. 

Searches for country code, US. 

Right now, works only on mac ( because osascript is being used).

Note that a verbal announcement is made when a movie is found. Working on making it such that the user can pick how they want to be notified.
